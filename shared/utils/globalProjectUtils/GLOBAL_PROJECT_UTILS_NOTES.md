# NOTES

## Guildlines
- Put utils which are global to the project here.
- Prefer scoped/module utils if possible, ie. if utils are only used in one folder put those utils there instead of here.

## Folders
- Use globalProjectUtils.js as a scratchpad for utils you cannot think of a good hierarchy for. If it is difficult to group it to something.
