# NOTES

## Guildlines
- Put general utils here, not utils specific to this project. 
- Most of the general utils already exists in the component lib so check there before adding something here.
- Only add utils here to test out new utils which should be added to the component lib when time allows.

## Folders
- Use generalUtils.js as a scratchpad for utils you cannot think of a good hierarchy for. If it is difficult to group it to something.
